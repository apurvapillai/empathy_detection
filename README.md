# At-a-Glance ðŸ‘€

This project focused on classifying empathy in text-based conversations using a fine-tuned RoBERTa model. Trained on over 7,000 annotated examples, the system achieved 92.1% accuracy, outperforming traditional models like logistic regression and SVMs by wide margins. Attention weight visualization techniques were also applied to interpret model decisions, helping to ensure transparency and trust during stakeholder evaluations.

# Problem

AI-powered systems like virtual assistants and mental health bots often lack emotional sensitivity. They can miss empathetic cues in conversations, resulting in mechanical or even harmful responses. The challenge here was to teach a machine learning model to recognize empathyâ€”a nuanced and subjective human traitâ€”using only textual cues. This involved not only improving prediction accuracy but also ensuring the modelâ€™s decisions were interpretable and explainable to non-technical users.

# Solution

The project used RoBERTa, a robustly optimized BERT variant, to leverage contextual embeddings that capture complex language semantics. Fine-tuning involved training the model on a labeled dataset of dialogue transcripts annotated for empathy presence or absence.

The deep learning approach surpassed classical machine learning models like logistic regression and SVM, which were limited by their inability to model word context and syntactic relationships. Achieving 92.1% accuracy demonstrated the modelâ€™s ability to capture emotional cues and nuanced language patterns.

Moreover, the project included visualization of attention weights, showing which parts of the dialogue the model focused on when making predictions. This transparency helped build trust among stakeholders, who could verify that the modelâ€™s decisions aligned with human intuition about empathy, supporting its adoption in sensitive applications.
